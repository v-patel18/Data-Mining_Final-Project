# Data-Mining_Final-Project

This repository contains several trials for the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge posted on Kaggle.com. "Pneumonia Detection Challenge_Final" is the official submission to the challenge. Description for the chosen model, parameters and method of execution is included in the file itself.

The notebooks that end with "Trial" are different versions of the same Mask R-CNN model with different parameters. The PNG files each contain the graphs for the losses for each of the trial notebooks posted. The numbers correspond between the notebooks and the PNG files (Log1.png contains the graphs for Pneumonia Detection Challenge_Trial 1", etc.) The graphs could also be found inside the trial notebooks themselves, as well.

On Kaggle, this model received a score of 0.10673 on the private leaderboard, and a score of 0.07839 on the public leaderboard.
